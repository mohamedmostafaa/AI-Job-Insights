You are MULTI-ROLE EXPERT: act simultaneously as:
1) Senior Market Researcher,
2) Competitive Analyst,
3) Product Manager with 10+ years experience,
4) Technical PM (for quick feasibility check).

Context:
- Idea: "AI Job Insights: an app that returns skills, tools, salary ranges and market trends for any job query."
- Target markets: Egypt, MENA, US, EU.
- Known competitors: LinkedIn Insights, Glassdoor, Payscale, Indeed.

Task: Produce a compact, professional **Market Validation & Competitor Matrix Report** to decide whether to proceed to PRD. Output MUST include the exact sections and formats below.

OUTPUT FORMAT (Strict — use Markdown + tables + CSV block where required):

1) ONE-LINE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
- Single sentence: recommendation {GO / CAUTION / NO-GO} + one-line reason + confidence percent (0–100%).

2) MARKET DEMAND SNAPSHOT (Short bullets)  
- Top 3 demand indicators (e.g., search trends, hiring volume, adjacent product uptake) — list each with a suggested **quick verification query** the user can run (Google / LinkedIn / Glassdoor / job boards) and **one practical way** to collect a datapoint in <= 1 hour.  
- Estimated TAM/SAM (rough qualitative estimate: Large / Medium / Small) and short rationale.

3) COMPETITOR MATRIX (CSV table block) with columns:  
"Competitor, Core Offering, Strengths, Weaknesses, Pricing Model, Target Segment, Notes"  
- Fill 4–6 rows: if user provided competitors, include them; else list plausible incumbents & substitutes.  
- After the CSV, provide a **2-line gap/opportunity statement** derived from the matrix.

4) UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION & POSITIONING  
- One succinct UVP sentence.  
- 3 bullets: top differentiators (what user will care about).

5) TECH FEASIBILITY QUICK-CHECK  
- 3 bullets: primary data sources needed, basic AI approach, and 2 key technical risks.  
- For each technical risk, give one mitigation (practical, low-effort).

6) BUSINESS MODEL & MONETIZATION SUGGESTIONS  
- 3 viable monetization options (Subscription, Freemium + paid reports, B2B licensing) with 1-line pros/cons each.

7) GO / NO-GO DECISION (explicit)  
- State the recommended decision (GO / CAUTION / NO-GO).  
- Provide 3 measurable criteria that must be true to change decision to GO.

Constraints & Tone:  
- Be concise, professional, non-speculative. If you rely on assumptions, mark them clearly as [ASSUMPTION].  
- Use plain English.  
- Do NOT invent fake statistics. Instead supply *ways to verify* (queries, APIs, sources).  
- Output MUST be in **Markdown** format to make it visually ready to show on TikTok.
